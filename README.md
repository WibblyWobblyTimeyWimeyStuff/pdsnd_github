## Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project I used Python and descriptive statistics to explore data associated with bike share systems with three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City and Washington

### Statistical Insights
1. Popular travel times:
    - common months
    - common days of the week
    - common hours of the day
2. Popular stations and trips:
    - common start station
    - common end station
    - common trips (start to end)
3. Trip duration:
    - total travel time
    - average travel time
4. User and customer information:
    - counts of each user type
    - counts of eac gender
    - earliest, most recent and most common years of birth

### Software Required
To run this you will require:
- Python 3, NumPy and Pandas installed using Anaconda

### Files
In order to run the python script, you will need the following files:
- chicago.csv;
- new_york_city.csv; and
- washington.csv
